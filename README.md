# Model l:Waste Production Ranking Model

This project implements a waste production ranking model to analyze waste production data from various regions and rank them based on the amount of wet and dry waste generated. The model provides insights into regions with the highest waste production, aiding waste management decision-making processes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the ranking model consists of transactional data from waste collection activities in 2019. The dataset includes the following columns:

- `region_id`: Identifier for each region (ranging from 1 to 100).
- `wet_waste`: Total amount of wet waste collected (in kilograms) in each region.
- `dry_waste`: Total amount of dry waste collected (in kilograms) in each region.

## Methodology

The waste production ranking model employs the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to aggregate waste production data for each region.

2. **Feature Engineering**: The model calculates the total amount of wet and dry waste produced in each region.

3. **Ranking Algorithm**: Using the aggregated waste production data, the model ranks the regions based on the total amount of wet and dry waste generated. The ranking algorithm assigns higher ranks to regions with greater waste production.

4. **Rank Visualization**: The model provides visualizations to depict the ranked list of regions based on wet and dry waste production. This allows stakeholders to identify regions with the highest waste production at a glance.



## Results

The waste production ranking model offers valuable insights into regional waste production patterns, enabling waste management authorities to prioritize resource allocation and implement targeted waste reduction strategies.

# MOdel 2:Waste Management Plant Location Recommendation System

This project aims to develop a waste management plant location recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes transactional data of waste collection from various regions and suggests optimal locations for setting up different types of waste processing plants (e.g., manure plants, biodegradable plants, recycling plants) based on waste production and proximity to high-production regions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model consists of transactional data from waste collection activities in 2019. The dataset includes the following columns:

- `truck_id`: Unique identifier for each waste collection truck.
- `day_no`: Day number (ranging from 1 to 90) indicating the day of the transaction.
- `region_id`: Identifier for each region (ranging from 1 to 100).
- `wet_waste`: Amount of wet waste collected (in kilograms).
- `dry_waste`: Amount of dry waste collected (in kilograms).

Additionally, the dataset contains distance information between regions, represented as a distance matrix.

## Methodology

The recommendation system employs the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features and calculate distances between regions.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Mean waste production (both wet and dry) is calculated for each region. Additionally, the distance to other regions is computed for each region.

3. **Model Training**: The processed dataset is used to train a machine learning model. In this case, the model is trained to predict the nearest region with high waste production for each potential plant location.

4. **Plant Location Recommendation**: Based on the trained model, potential plant locations are identified for different types of waste processing plants. For example, locations with high wet waste production are recommended for manure and biodegradable plants, while locations with high dry waste production are recommended for recycling plants.

5. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to recommend suitable plant locations that optimize waste processing efficiency and minimize transportation costs.




## Results

The recommendation system provides actionable insights for waste management stakeholders, helping them make informed decisions about plant location selection and waste processing optimization.
